                <h1>Thoughts on The Internet</h1>
                <h5>September, 2021</h5>
                <p class="blog-page">One of the most significant leaps of technology in the past few decades has
                    resulted in the formation of the Internet. The Internet has created many opportunities for people
                    from all walks of life and has affected everyone drastically.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-page">
                    It was first developed at a smaller scale for the army to communicate at the battlefront, but this
                    technology was later brought to public use. As a result, it has revolutionized the way everyone
                    lives and has provided new opportunities to people in every way possible. Whether it is E-Commerce
                    platforms or communication, the Internet plays a huge role in all places.
                <p class="blog-page">But even after so many benefits, the Internet is not without any vices. Though the
                    Internet has made our lives easier, it has also made us more dependent on it. It has become the
                    leading cause of distraction among people, and many people, including children, are becoming
                    addicted to it.

                <p class="blog-page">
                    Moreover, with the ease of access to information now, anyone can access any data regardless of its
                    appropriateness. Thus we can say that though Internet has made our life far better, in the wrong
                    hands, it can hamper one's life considerably.
                    Now that we are all basically growing up on the internet, we need to learn to take a step back
                    whenever needed.
